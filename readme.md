# Airbnb Major Project

Airbnb Major Project is a full-featured Airbnb clone that allows users to browse listings, register/login, and manage their reservations. Built with Node.js and Express, this project implements user authentication, dynamic routing, and responsive UI rendering using server-side views.



## Live Demo

**Please Note:**  
The backend is hosted on Render. After extended periods of inactivity, the backend goes to sleep, which may result in a delay of up to 20 seconds on the first request.
